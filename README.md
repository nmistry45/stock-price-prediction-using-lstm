# Steps to run on local machine/jupyter notebook:

To run this assignment on your local machine, you need the following software installed.

```
Anaconda Environment
Python
```

To install Python, download it from the following link and install it on your local machine:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

To install Anaconda, download it from the following link and install it on your local machine:

https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

After installing the required software, clone the repo, and run the following command for opening the code in jupyter notebook.

```
jupyter notebook FP-TrushitaMaurya-NishitMistry.ipynb
```

This command will open up a browser window with jupyter notebook loading the project code.

You need to **upload the dataset from the git repo to your jupyter notebook environment.**

# Steps to run on Google Colab:

1. Upload the ipynb file to Colab.
2. Go to runtime, and click on "Change runtime type".
3. Select "GPU" from the drop-down and hit "Save".
4. **Upload the dataset from the git repo to your colab local files.**
5. Go to runtime, and click on "Run all".

These steps will run the entire project code without any issues.
If you selected GPU, it might take 15-20 mins and if you did not change the runtime type and kept it as CPU, it might take longer around 30-35 mins.

## Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
